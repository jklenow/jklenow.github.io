    <p>I am currently a PhD student in Cognition and Perception at New York University, where I work with Elizabeth Phelps and Nathaniel Daw. Broadly, I am interested in the neurocognitive mechanisms by which we assign value to, act upon, and gather information about our environments. Within these processes, I am particularly interested in the role of contextâ€”both internal (affective and neuromodulatory) and external (task structural and environmental).</p>
